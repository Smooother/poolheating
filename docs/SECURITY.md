# Security Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the pool heating system and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

## üîí Implemented Security Measures

### Database Security

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Policies restrict access to service role only
- No direct user access to sensitive data

#### Extension Isolation
- `pg_net` extension moved to dedicated `extensions` schema
- Prevents potential privilege escalation
- Follows PostgreSQL security best practices

#### Audit Logging
- `audit_log` table tracks sensitive operations
- `log_audit_event()` function for logging changes
- Service role can monitor all operations

### API Security

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Service role for all backend operations
- No user authentication required (single-user system)
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration

#### Input Validation
- All API endpoints validate input parameters
- Temperature bounds checking (18-35¬∞C)
- Boolean validation for power commands

#### Error Handling
- Generic error messages to prevent information leakage
- Proper HTTP status codes
- No sensitive data in error responses

### Network Security

#### CORS Configuration
- Proper CORS headers on all API endpoints
- Allows requests from configured origins
- Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests

#### HTTPS
- All production traffic over HTTPS
- Vercel provides automatic SSL/TLS
- No sensitive data transmitted over HTTP

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- All sensitive data in environment variables
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use Vercel environment variable management

### Database Access
- Service role has minimal required permissions
- No direct database access from frontend
- All database operations through API endpoints

### API Endpoints
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting through Vercel
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging
The system logs all sensitive operations:

```sql
-- Example audit log entry
SELECT * FROM public.audit_log 
WHERE table_name = 'automation_settings' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### Monitoring Points
- Temperature changes
- Power state changes
- Automation decisions
- Price data updates
- Configuration changes

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If a Security Issue is Discovered

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Disable affected functionality if necessary
   - Review audit logs for suspicious activity
   - Check for unauthorized access

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze the security issue
   - Review recent changes
   - Check system logs

3. **Remediation**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update policies if needed
   - Test fixes thoroughly

4. **Prevention**
   - Update security measures
   - Review and improve policies
   - Document lessons learned

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] RLS policies enabled and tested
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling secure
- [ ] Audit logging functional

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Review audit logs monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Monitor for security advisories
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Review access permissions

### After Changes
- [ ] Test all security measures
- [ ] Verify RLS policies still work
- [ ] Check audit logging
- [ ] Validate input handling
- [ ] Review error messages

## üîß Security Configuration

### Supabase Configuration
```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create restrictive policies
CREATE POLICY "Service role only" ON table_name
FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

### Vercel Configuration
```json
{
  "env": {
    "SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-project.supabase.co",
    "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "your-service-role-key"
  }
}
```
